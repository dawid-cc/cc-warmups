## The Challenge

Here’s the JavaScript code snippet for today:

```
function addToArray(element, arr = []) {
  const newArr = [...arr];
  newArr.push(element);
  return newArr;
}

let result1 = addToArray(1);
let result2 = addToArray(2);

console.log(result1);
console.log(result2);
```

**Question**: What is the output of this code, and why does it happen?

 ### Solution
In this code, we have a function `addToArray` that takes an element and an optional array (`arr`). If no array is provided, it defaults to an empty array `[]`. Inside the function, a new array (`newArr`) is created by copying the elements of `arr` using the spread operator (`…arr`), then the given `element` is pushed into `newArr`. The function returns the new array.

Here’s what happens step-by-step:

- When `addToArray(1)` is called, `arr` is initialized to an empty array `[]`, and `1` is added to it, resulting in `[1]`. This result is stored in `result1`.
- When `addToArray(2)` is called, `arr` is again initialized to an empty array `[]`, and `2` is added to it, resulting in `[2]`. This result is stored in `result2`.

So, the output is:

```
[1]
[2]
```

Each time the function is called without providing an `arr` argument, a new empty array is created, ensuring that the two results (`result1` and `result2`) are independent of each other.

### Correcting the Code (If Needed)

In this particular example, the code works as intended, as each call to `addToArray` creates a new independent array, avoiding unintended side effects. However, if you want to accumulate elements into the same array across multiple function calls, you need to explicitly pass the same array to the function and update it.

For example:

```
let sharedArray = [];
sharedArray = addToArray(1, sharedArray);
sharedArray = addToArray(2, sharedArray);

console.log(sharedArray);
```

This would result in:

```
[1, 2]

```

In this version, the array (`sharedArray`) is updated with each function call, and the elements are accumulated into the same array as expected.

### Why It Matters

Understanding how default parameters work and how to manage references to arrays is crucial for writing reliable JavaScript code. This challenge highlights the importance of ensuring that you correctly handle default values and avoid unexpected sharing of mutable data between function calls.
