## The Challenge

Here’s the JavaScript code snippet for today:

```
function createCounters() {
  let counters = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    counters.push(function() {
      return i;
    });
  }
  return counters;
}

const counters = createCounters();
console.log(counters[0]());
console.log(counters[1]());
console.log(counters[2]());
```

**Question**: What will be the output of this code, and why does it happen? How can you fix it?

 ### Solution
When `createCounters` is called, it uses a loop to create three functions, each of which is pushed into the `counters` array. You might expect that each of these functions would return `0`, `1`, and `2`, respectively, but instead, all of them return `3`. Let’s break down why this happens.

The issue lies with the use of `var` to declare the loop variable `i`. In JavaScript, `var` is function-scoped, meaning it’s shared across all iterations of the loop. By the time the loop completes, the value of `i` is `3`, and because each function maintains a reference to the same `i`, calling `counters[0]()`, `counters[1]()`, and `counters[2]()` will all return `3`.

### How to Fix It

To solve this issue, you need to create a separate scope for each iteration of the loop. This can be done in a couple of ways:

#### 1. Using `let` Instead of `var`:

```
function createCounters() {
  let counters = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    counters.push(function () {
      return i;
    });
  }
  return counters;
}

```

Since `let` is block-scoped, each iteration of the loop will have its own `i`, meaning each function will capture the correct value.

#### 2. Using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):

```
function createCounters() {
  let counters = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    (function (i) {
      counters.push(function () {
        return i;
      });
    })(i);
  }
  return counters;
}
```

By using an IIFE, we create a new scope for each iteration, effectively capturing the current value of `i` inside the function.

###Corrected Output
With either of the fixes above, the output of the code would be:

```
0
1
2
```

### Why It Matters

This challenge is a great reminder of the difference between `var` and `let` in JavaScript and how closures interact with variables. Understanding how scoping works is crucial for avoiding subtle bugs, especially when working with loops and asynchronous code.
