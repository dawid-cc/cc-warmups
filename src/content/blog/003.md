## The Challenge

Take a look at the following JavaScript code snippet:

```
function mysteryFunction(a) {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    result += (a[i] % 2 === 0) ? a[i] : 0;
  }
  return result;
}

console.log(mysteryFunction([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]));
```

**Question**: What will be the output of this code, and why?

 ### Solution
The function `mysteryFunction` takes an array `a` as input and initializes a variable `result` to `0`. It then iterates over each element of the array, checking if the current element is even. If the element is even, it’s added to `result`. Finally, the function returns `result`.

Breaking it down:

- The array passed in is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The `for` loop iterates through each element of the array.
  — `1` is odd, so it’s not added.
  — `2` is even, so `2` is added to `result` (result is now `2`).
  — `3` is odd, so it’s not added.
  — `4` is even, so `4` is added to `result` (result is now `6`).
  — `5` is odd, so it’s not added.
- The final value of `result` is `6`.

Therefore, the output of the `console.log` statement will be:

```
5
```

### Why It Matters

This challenge is designed to help you get comfortable with basic looping and conditional logic in JavaScript. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for writing efficient and readable code.
